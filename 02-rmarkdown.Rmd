# RMarkdown

## How it works

An RMarkdown document looks like any other markdown document with two additions. 

1. The YAML front matter. The only mandatory field is the `output:` tag. Here we're using HTML, but we'll look at other output formats later. Other tags are optional, but fields like `title`, `author`, and `date` can be used to create document headings as well as metadata into the output document.
2. R code chunks. 

Authoring documents with RMarkdown starts with a `.Rmd` file that contains a combination of markdown and R code chunks. The .Rmd file is fed to knitr, which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new temporary plain markdown (.md) document which includes the R code and the output that code produced. The markdown file generated by knitr is then rendered into a web page (HTML), PDF, MS Word document, and other output formats. This is all done with a single render function, or by clicking the "Knit" button in RStudio (CMD-Shift-K).
